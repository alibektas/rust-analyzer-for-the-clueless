## About 

A Rust Analyzer reference mdbook that should guide you in your journey to becoming a long-time contributor.

## What this book offers

Let's be frank, rust-analyzer ( from now on always referred to as **RA** ) is not heavily documented. If you are also someone who wants to contribute to this project you will possibly go through some difficult times as the project is a large one with some tens of crates, each responsible for a different functionality. This book doesn't claim to be a documentation but rather a collection of **FAQ**s. During your journey you may find some certain entries useful for the contributions you are planning to make.

## Contributing

By the time I started to write this book my knowledge in Rust and rust-analyzer was rather weak, so be ready to find find stuff that needs correcting. If you spot mistakes do not hesitate to make a PR. Before doing so please check guidelines to [contribution](./contributing/README.md)
